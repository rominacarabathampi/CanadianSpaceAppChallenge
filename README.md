# Canadian Space Agency Challenge - Radi-N2

_Note: This is still work in progress. I am currently finishing up the codes._

This is the code to the Space App Challenge competition that took place in Wateloo in 18-20 Oct 2019.

The file `code.ipynb` contains the exploratory and data cleaning file of the data provided in the Radi-N2 challenge. 
The files `` and  `` contain the two files provided by the Canadian Space Agency as datasets for the competition

## Goal:
Help Canadians visualize and interpret radiation data collected on the ISS during the missions of Canadian astronauts David Saint-Jacques, Chris Hadfield and Robert Thirsk, and collected on land at various locations across Canada.

The results of my data cleaning have been used by Tian (https://tliu2014.github.io/spacehacks/)[here] and Alex to build (https://yuanxinwang.github.io/nasa)[this]. 
Shoutout to rest of the team: Amin, Reinhardt, Mridhulaa and Areesa for working on this and winning.

Special thank you to Skywatch for hosting and organizing this event, to Canadian Space Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration for their respective work in this event.
