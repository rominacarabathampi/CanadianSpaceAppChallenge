# Canadian Space Agency Challenge - Radi-N2

This is the code to the Space App Challenge competition that took place in Wateloo in 18-20 Oct 2019.

The file `code.ipynb` contains the exploratory and data cleaning file of the data provided in the Radi-N2 challenge. 
The files `Radi-N2 -ISS data` and  `Radi-N2 -Schools Project` contain the two files provided by the Canadian Space Agency as datasets for the competition. 

- ISS data refers to the data collected on the International Space Station.
- Schools Project refers to the data collected by the schools across Canada that have participated in the Radi-N2 and You project.

The folder `data` contains the datafiles that were resulted from my team's research and work.

## Goal:
Help Canadians visualize and interpret radiation data collected on the ISS during the missions of Canadian astronauts David Saint-Jacques, Chris Hadfield and Robert Thirsk, and collected on land at various locations across Canada.

## Links to the teammates projects
The results of my data cleaning have been used by Tian https://tliu2014.github.io/spacehacks/ and Alex to build https://yuanxinwang.github.io/nasa. 
Shoutout to rest of the team: Amin, Reinhardt, Mridhulaa and Areesa for working on this and winning.
